# University Python Projects

## Description
This repository contains all of my Python projects from Colorado State University Global's IT320 Basic Programming class.
The purpose of this repository is for me to keep all of my previous programs and utilize them for reference in my programming journey.
The <b>Discussion Posts</b> folder contains all of the programs that have been used in my discussion posts for the following course.

## [Vehicle Details](https://github.com/elizacodes/uni-python-projects/blob/main/Vehicle%20Details.py)
This Python program incorporates appropriate data types and provides program output in a logical manner based on the following user input:
- Car Brand
- Model
- Year
- Starting Odometer Reading
- Ending Odometer Reading
- Estimated Miles Per Gallon
  
The following data from the user input has been stored into a dictionary and it has been printed out as the following output.

## [Weekly Average Tax Withholding]
This program calculates the weekly average tax withholding for a customer. The customer will input their following weekly income and the program will provide an output of the tax rate, the income after taxes, and the amount of taxes that have been taken from the customer's weekly income. The following conditions are met:
- Income *less than $500*: tax rate is 10%
- Income *greater than/equal to $500 and less than $1500*: tax rate is 15%
- Income *greater than/equal to $1500 and less than $2500*: tax rate is 20%
- Income *greater than/equal to $2500*: tax rate is 30%
